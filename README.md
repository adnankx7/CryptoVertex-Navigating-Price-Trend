# 🚀 CryptoVertex: Navigation Crypto Price Trend

**CryptoVertex** is an interactive web application for navigating and forecasting cryptocurrency price trends. It leverages real-time data, technical indicators, and deep learning models (LSTM & GRU) to provide users with insights into market direction and future price predictions — all wrapped in a clean Flask-based interface with beautiful visualizations powered by Chart.js.

## 📌 Project Overview

CryptoVertex was developed as a full-stack data science project to demonstrate how machine learning and deep learning models can be applied to the financial domain — specifically, cryptocurrency price prediction. The project involves scraping live crypto data, applying financial technical indicators, training DL models, and delivering real-time visual output to end users.
